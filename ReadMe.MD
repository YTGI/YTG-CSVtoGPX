### Convert CSV file to GPX file for Waypoints

<p>This is a simple.NET Framework (4.7.2) WPF application that imports a CSV file in the format located in the \Files folder.</p>
<p>It generates a GPX file that is compliant with GARMIN products. It is likely compliant with most GPS products, but I don't own any others to test with.</p>
<p>If you want a simple way to import some data you have into a file that will display in your GPS for navigation, then this is a simple way to accomplish that.</p>
<p><b>Please Note:</b></p>
<p>We're releasing this utility as an open source project, however, we don't have any intention on improving or maintaining it past what we need for our own uses.</p>
<p><b>Also Note:</b></p>
<p>All of your entries MUST have a Latitude and Longitude in decimal format present. The CSV parser blows chunks on empty fields! I didn't look into whether this could be overridden, as I really don't want them in my GPX file anyway.</p>
